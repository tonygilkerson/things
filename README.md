# Things

This repo is intended to hold the notes and code examples that I work through as I am learning how to program microcontrollers.

## Why?

My current goal is to learn how to program [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) based microcontrollers. I grow cut flowers, have a greenhouse and as a result I have several automation projects in mind, mostly involved with watering, climate control and tracking.  I also have a few project ideas for my computerized telescope to automate long imaging sessions. A secondary goal is to use a "real" programming language like C++ and Go for may projects.  I have looked at the Arduino IDE, which seems to be very popular, but I am not really interested.  Same for the visual programming tools that I have seen. 

## What?

This repo will have several subfolders each containing the source code and doc for some project. The first subfolder `proj01` is me working through a "hello world" project, which for microcontrollers is a blinking LED. The code is not that interesting but my notes will be from the point of view of a newbie and thus may contain things that were useful to me at the the time.
