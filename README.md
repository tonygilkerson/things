# Things

This repo is intended to hold the notes and code examples that I work through as I am learning how to program microcontrollers.

## Why?

My current goal is to learn how to program microcontrollers such as the [Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) or [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32). I have several automation projects in mind, mostly involved with watering, climate control and tracking.  I also have a few project ideas for my computerized telescope to automate long imaging sessions. A secondary goal is to use a "real" programming language like Go for may projects.  I have looked at the Arduino IDE, which seems to be very popular, but I am not really interested.  Same for the visual programming tools that I have seen.

## What?

This repo has several subfolders each containing the source code and doc for some project. The first subfolder `proj01` is me working through a "hello world" project, which for a microcontrollers is a blinking LED. The code is not that interesting but my notes will be from the point of view of a newbie and thus may contain things that were useful to me at the the time.
