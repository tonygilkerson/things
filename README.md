# Things

This repo is intended to hold the notes and code examples that I work through as I am learning how to program microcontrollers.

## Why?

My current goal is to learn how to program [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) based microcontrollers. I grow cut flowers, have a greenhouse and as a result I have several automation projects in mind, mostly involved with watering, climate control and tracking.  I also have a few project ideas for my computerized telescope to automate long imaging sessions.

A secondary goal is to use a "real" programming language like C++ and Go for may projects.  I have looked at the Arduino IDE, which seems to be very popular, but I am not really interested.  Same for the visual programming tools that I have seen. However, I am considering using the visual tools for the [M5 Stack](https://docs.m5stack.com/) because they look like a good learing tool.  I can develop visually and then convert to C++, that might be useful as a stop-gap, but my end goal is to not use the visual programming tools.

## What?

This repo will have several subfolders each containing the source code and doc for some project. The first subfolder `example01` is me working through a "hello world" project, which for microcontrollers is a blinking LED. The code is not that interesting but my notes will be from the point of view of a newbie and thus may contain things that were useful to me at the the time.
