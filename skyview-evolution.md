This might be the [data sheet](http://www.motionking.com/Products/PM_Stepper_Motors/42PM_Stepper_Motor.htm) I am not sure:

Information for this motor and mount was hard to find but I believe the following to be true, although I could be wrong:

* drive motor period = 48 steps
* "tin can" gearbox attached to drive motor = 120:1
* motor w/tin can period = 48*120 = 5760 steps
* RA worm gear = 144:1
* RA period = 5760*144 = 829,440 steps
* drive motor wiring
  * coil A - Green and Yellow
  * coil B - Red and Brown
  * 42PM48L(CZ) RoHS NO:20160720
