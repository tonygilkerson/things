# Getting To Blinky

This section is for the project files as I work through this tutorial.

Note: I created `kicad/proj` following along with the *gitting to blinky* tutorial but did not realize until late that it was for surface mount components.  `kicad/proj2` is my attempt to redo the same tutorial but with Through Hole Technology Mounting (THT) components.

* `kicad/proj` - SMT
* `kicad/proj2` - THT
