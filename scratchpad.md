Stuff that I find that I need to organize...

* **EasyDriver A3967 Stepper Motor Driver Tutorial** ([www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafoHAhz8Ys)) - This is a way to do microstepping also, you can enable/disable the motor via logic board to allow for manual adjustment of the mount, very interesting, not sure if I would need that if I got everything thing else working but it is an interesting option.
